I had trained a bit since then and also upgraded to lighter wheels, so I was confident of finishing with the peloton. So for me the goals for this race were to ride more aggressively, stay towards the front of the peloton, try an attack or join attacks  etc.  (yeah I missed chasing down attacks in the goal list :)).","name":"Ajith"},{"comment":"A blog (a truncation of \"weblog\") is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts).
